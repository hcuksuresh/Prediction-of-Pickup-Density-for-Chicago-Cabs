# Conclusion

In this project with the help of explicit of data visualization and predictive modeling we analyzed how Chicago Transportation Authority (CTA) should develop strategies in order to stay ahead of the competition. Tech savvy giants like Uber and Lyft have advanced their businesses by using these common but important data science tools and techniques. We showed in this report how return on investment for the taxi business can be increased by focusing on some key points.

In the report we mentioned how business areas of Chicago are the key areas for revenue growth. Even with the emergence of Uber, number of rides have not gone down in these areas as compared to other parts of the city. Holidays and weather data plays important role in determination of number of rides and total fare; hence CTA should consider all these parameters while allocating their resources. We also addressed some anomalies like why at some point in the day total fare is less but average fare is very high.

We were able to build fairly accurate predictive models for weekly, daily and hourly aggregated data. This will provide an edge to Chicago Taxis as they will be able to eliminate some uncertainties associated with the ride. Our light GBM yields out the most important factors that a taxi firm should use to determine the total trip amount.

For future work we want to make use of the entire dataset for predictive modeling by making use of Amazon Web Services.
